  In a dark room we fight <br />
  Make up for our love <br />
  I've been thinking, thinking 'bout you <br />
  'Bout us <br />
  And we're moving slow <br />
  Our hearts beat so fast <br />
  I've been dreaming, dreaming 'bout you <br />
  'Bout us <br />

  [Ad-Libs] <br />
  Hey <br />
  Hey <br />
  Hey <br />
  Hey <br />

  [Chorus] <br />
  My head is a jungle, jungle <br />
  My head is a jungle, jungle <br />
  My head is a jungle, jungle <br />
  My head, oh <br />

  [Verse 2] <br />
  I'm speaking soft <br />
  To the pain in your eyes <br />
  I've been Feelin', feelin' for you <br />
  My love <br />
  And our bodies are tired <br />
  Our shadows will dance <br />
  I've been achin' achin' for you <br />
  My love <br />
  <br />
  [Chorus] <br />
  <br />
  [Verse 3] <br />
  My love is wasted, sorry for this I never meant to be <br />
  Hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves and I'm <br />
  Complicated, you won't get me, I have trouble <br />
  Understanding myself, understanding myself and my <br />
  Love is wasted, sorry for this I never meant to be <br />
  Hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves and I'm <br />
  Complicated, you won't get me, I have trouble <br />
  Understanding myself, understanding myself <br />
  <br />
  [Chorus] <br />
  <br />
  [Ad-Libs] <br />
  Ho-oh-oh <br />
  Ho-oh-oh, oh <br />
  Ho-oh-oh <br />
  Ho-oh <br />
  Ho-oh-oh (My head is a jungle) <br />
  Ho-oh-oh, oh (My head is a jungle) <br />
  Ho-oh-oh (My head is a jungle) <br />
  Ho-oh <br />
